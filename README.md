The first game I built in 2020. It was meant to be a simple map generator for a game idea that I had but the complexity and challenge took over and I ended up speeding a couple of months on it. You can specify the size of the maps and the number of territories which dictates the number of starting points for the seeds. Maps contain biomes like desent and swamp but they need some more customisation. Rivers move from high elevation to low elevation merging together and heading towards bodies of water. I variety of different resources spawn allowing for games to use a complex array of information. You can save and load the maps you create but additional functionality is required for file management. A lot of time was spent on efficiency and this shows at how the map takes about a minute to generate on sizes of about 300x300 squares. I would like to go through it and make it more efficient now that I have more experience.
